# Password Generator

## Description
Having trouble coming up with a password for something? Or maybe you feel like your current passwords need improvement. If so, feel free to use this application to generate a random password for you that matches criteria you decide. I have developed this password generator with javascript as practice to strengthen my javascript foundational skills. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To get started with the application, click the red "Generate Password" button. You will then be shown a series of prompts that you can answer as you please to further customize your random password. Once you have completed each of the prompts, your random generated password will appear in the box with the dashed outline. 

For your viewing convenience, a screenshot preview of the webpage is attached below this section. Here is a link to the live application: https://halversonm.github.io/password-generator/
